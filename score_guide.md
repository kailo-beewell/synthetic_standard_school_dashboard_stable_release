# Scoring guide

This table summarises the directionality of scoring on each question and for
each score overall, along with explaining what the max score "means" for each
topic, and what the overall range of possible scores are (for the questions and topics).

I have not forced all high scores to be positive (or all to be negative), as having multiple possible directions can be more intuitive when thinking about it alongside the question (which vary between being positive or negative at high scores), and as we want to match up to the scores in GM (which was a priority).

To see exactly how scores were calculated, please see the relevant sections of Python code in this repository.

Abbreviations:
* GM (Greater Manchester) - referring to their dashboards from implementation of #BeeWell.
* exc. (exclude) - often for responses that would exclude from scoring like "don't know" or "unsure"
